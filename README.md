# Auction House - Semester Project 2

## About the Project

**Auction House** is an exclusive platform for buying and selling luxury items, specializing in **watches**, **handbags**, **bags**, and **jewelry**. Our mission is to create a refined, user-friendly experience that matches the elegance of the products featured on our platform.

This project is the **frontend implementation** of Auction House, built on an existing backend API provided by Noroff. The API handles user management, auction listings, and bidding functionality, while this frontend will bring the user interface to life with a luxurious, responsive design.

## Features 

- Users can register using an email address ending in @stud.noroff.no.
- A registered user can log in. On our platform, users are automatically logged in upon registration.
- A registered user can log out.
- As a registered user, you can update your profile banner, profile picture, and bio.
- On your personal profile page, you can view your available credits.
- A registered user can create a listing that includes: title, description, deadline date, category, and images.
- As a registered user, you can place bids on other users' listings.
- As a registered user, you can view bids on listings.
- Visitors who are not registered can browse listings but cannot place bids or view profiles.
- The Wishlist feature is a proof of concept. It is implemented using local storage since the API does not support this functionality or custom fields.
- The "Listings Won" page currently appears empty. While we aimed to implement this feature to enhance the authenticity of the site, discussions with instructors clarified that this was not feasible due to API limitations. However, the page has been included for visual purposes.
