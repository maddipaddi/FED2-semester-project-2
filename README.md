# Auction House - Semester Project 2

## About the Project

**Auction House** is an exclusive platform for buying and selling luxury items, specializing in **watches**, **handbags**, **bags**, and **jewelry**. Our mission is to create a refined, user-friendly experience that matches the elegance of the products featured on our platform.

This project is the **frontend implementation** of Auction House, built on an existing backend API provided by Noroff. The API handles user management, auction listings, and bidding functionality, while this frontend will bring the user interface to life with a luxurious, responsive design.
