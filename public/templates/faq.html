        <p>
          "My active listings" are the listings that you've added that are
          currently active and that others can bid on. "My previous listings"
          are inactive listings that have either been sold or have reached the
          auction deadline.

        <p>
          "My wishlist" are the listings that you've added to your wishlist that
          you are interested in, but have not put in bids for yet. "My active
          bids" are listings that you have placed a bid on that are still
          active. Your last bid can be seen as "My current bid". To see all bids
